# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: OOP is another way to say it. This kind of programing is used for solve complex problems by assigning data to key value pairs. In most languages you can write code that follows that style of programming. It allow the system to opitmally read and find data and sort through data. Functional programming is writing code with no data stucture in mind, just passing in information and returning information. Its not as organized at making all the data in objects.

Researched answer: It focuses on objects with data that devs want maniplulate, great for large data sets and solving complex problems The structure of OOP include Classes, Object, Methods, and Attributes. Functional Programming is more closer to mathematical func, focusing on what needs to be solved.

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: A Interger is a whole number with no deciaml. A float is a number with a decimal.

Researched answer: Float is number with a decimal, interger is a whole number with no decimal. both can use for mathematical expressions. 

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: It means that the func. methods will return something with out asking the system for an output. It allows for less code and it can simplify code with the correct method.


Researched answer: Means that Ruby methods will return the value of the last line, there is no need to use the return statement. It is built into Ruby making it easy to use and collect data. 

4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: Its is a block of code is passed in some data to do something with it. Some examples of ruby Block are each, while, range, and map


Researched answer: Ruby block is an anonymous func this passed to a method to return a new outcome. They will have do and end. It is very useful when looking through many items/ objects. 

1. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer:To extract a value in a Ruby Hash you need to call the name of the variable, followed by [:key_name] and then you will have a return of the value at that key.

Researched answer:
(example) recipe = { flour: '2 1/4 cups', sugar: '1 cup', eggs: 2 }

recipe[:sugar] // will return '1 cup' becuase the key[:sugar] is being called in the recipe hash.
 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. PostgreSQL: It is a type of relational database. Postgre is a type of SQL and there many different kinds. Postgre is object relational database which is structured for OOP

2. Ruby on Rails: It is a sever side web app framework writting in Ruby, Rails is a MVC(model-view-controller) framework, great for structure of databases, web services, and building web pages.

3. ORM:(Object-Relational-Mapping) A type of technique that lets your send and update data using object oriented paradigm. Can be used instead of SQL

4. Active Record: It is a interface between Rails and the database, it has its own syntax to make querys to the data base, similar to SQL

5. Migrations: Used to change the shape(naming) of an existing database, you can add or remove columns, change the name of column or data type of columns
